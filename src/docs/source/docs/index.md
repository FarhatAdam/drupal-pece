About
=====================

The Platform for Experimental, Collaborative Ethnography (PECE) is open source (Drupal-based) software supporting virtual research environments for cultural anthropologists, historians, cultural heritage scholars, and other researchers working with diverse data, including extensive unstructured data, largely through interpretive methods.  Designed to support the workflows, data types and interpretive modalities particular to  these scholars in what we call the “empirical humanities,” it also provides a platform for deeply interdisciplinary collaboration with transnational scope. PECE provides space to archive and curate data, facilitates collaborative analysis of data, and enables diverse modes of visualization, scholarly communication, and peer review.

There are now many instances of PECE, supporting diverse research communities and projects.  Work on the following instances of PECE informs our on-going software development: [The Asthma Files](https://theasthmafiles.org/) | [The Energy Vulnerability Project](http://housingenergy.info/) | [The Disaster STS Network](https://disaster-sts-network.org/) | [Center for Ethnography](http://centerforethnography.org/) | [STS Infrastructures](https://stsinfrastructures.org/) | [Research Data Share](https://www.researchdatashare.org/) |  [World PECE](https://worldpece.org/) |
